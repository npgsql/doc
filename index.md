# Npgsql - .NET Access to PostgreSQL

## About

Npgsql is an open source ADO.NET Data Provider for PostgreSQL, it allows programs written in C#, Visual Basic, F# to access the PostgreSQL database server.
It is implemented in 100% C# code, is free and is open source.

An Entity Framework Core provider is also available, and exposes some features unique to the PostgreSQL database to EF Core users.

Finally, a legacy Entity Framework 6.x (non-Core) provider is also available, but is no longer being actively maintained.

## Getting Help

The best way to get help for Npgsql is to post a question to Stack Overflow and tag it with the `npgsql` tag.
If you think you've encountered a bug or want to request a feature, open an issue in the [appropriate project's github repository](https://github.com/npgsql).
