### Obsoleted default column collations

Versions 6.0 and below had a mechanism that allowed defining a "default column collation", which is applied individually to every text column by default; this differed from the database collation, which is applied once to the database at creation time. This mechanism was introduced because in PostgreSQL, the database collation is quite limited, and for example does not allow specifying non-deterministic collations (e.g. case-insensitive ones).

However, with the introduction of [pre-convention model configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/core/modeling/bulk-configuration#pre-convention-configuration) in EF Core, it's now possible to use that generic mechanism for specifying the default collation. As a result, the Npgsql-specific mechanism has been obsoleted and will be removed in a future version.

Default column collations involve the following code:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.UseDefaultColumnCollation("<collation_name>");
}
```

To switch to the standard EF Core API, replace the code above with the following:

```c#
protected override void ConfigureConventions(ModelConfigurationBuilder configurationBuilder)
{
    configurationBuilder.Properties<string>().UseCollation("<collation_name>");
}
```
