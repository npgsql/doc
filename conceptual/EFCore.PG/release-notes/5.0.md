# 5.0 (RC) Release Notes

Release candidates of version 5.0 of the Npgsql Entity Framework Core provider are available on nuget.org. These versions work with the corresponding RC versions of [Entity Framework Core 5.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-5.0/whatsnew), and brings new Npgsql features in addition to the general EF Core changes.

The full list of issues for this release is [available here](https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/milestone/24?closed=1).

## New Features

Aside from general EF Core features new in 5.0, here is a non-exhaustive list of features added in the Npgsql EF Core provider:

* Full support for PostgreSQL collations. [See the docs](http://www.npgsql.org/efcore/misc/collations-and-case-sensitivity.html?tabs=data-annotations) for more info.
* It is now much easier to create indexes for full-text search ([#1097](https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/1097), [#1253](https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/1253)). [See the docs](www.npgsql.org/efcore/mapping/full-text-search.html) for more info.
* Sequences are now automatically updated after seeding data to avoid duplicate values ([#367](https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/367)).
* [The `[JsonPropertyName]` attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.text.json.serialization.jsonpropertynameattribute) is now respected when mapping to JSON ([#1419](https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/1419)).
* Improved support for PostgreSQL arrays:
  * Mapping `List<T>` is now fully supported ([#395](https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/395)).
  * Mapping arrays of nullable value types (e.g. `int?[]`) is now supported ([#1025](https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/1025)).
* Query translations:
  * [Precise, exhaustive documentation](http://www.npgsql.org/efcore/mapping/translations.html) has been added on which functions can be used in LINQ queries.
  * `Contains` over arrays now uses indexes in various scenarios, improving performance ([#1372](https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/1372)).
  * Various members of [TimeSpan](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.timespan?view=netcore-3.1) are now translated and can be used in queries ([#328](https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/328)).
  * Support for [unaccent](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/unaccent.html) ([#1530](https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/1530)). Thanks [@cloudlucky](https://github.com/cloudlucky).
  * Various translations over byte array properties have been added ([#1225](https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/1225), [#1226](https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/1226).
* Improved null semantics for PostgreSQL-specific operations results in tighter and more efficient SQL ([#1142](https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/1142)).
* Better support for NodaTime:
  * It is now possible to map NodaTime `Duration` to PostgreSQL `interval`, previously only `Period` could be mapped ([#1567](https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/1567).
  * Some additional arithmetic operation are now translated ([#1565](https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/1565)).
* It is now possible to add labels to existing enums (but not remove or modify existing ones). The provider will generate the appropriate migrations ([#1182](https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/1182)).

## Breaking changes

Please consult the EF Core 5.0 [breaking changes page](https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-5.0/breaking-changes) as well - the below lists only changes specific to the Npgsql provider.

### Computed columns must now explicitly be configured as stored ([#1336](https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/1336))

Version 3.1 of the provider added support for [PostgreSQL generated columns](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-generated-columns.html) ([#939](https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/939)), referred to as [computed columns in EF Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/core/modeling/generated-properties?tabs=data-annotations#computed-columns). EF Core 5.0 adds support for specifying whether a computed column is *virtual* (computed when fetched), or *stored* (persisted on disk and computed when modified). Aligning with most databases, EF Core by default creates virtual computed columns, but these are currently unsupported by PostgreSQL.

As a result, you must explicitly specify on all computed columns that they are stored:

```c#
modelBuilder.Entity<Customer>()
    .Property(p => p.FullName)
    .HasComputedColumnSql("...", stored: true);
```

### IsCreatedConcurrently defaults to true ([#1212](https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/1212))

Previously, when `IsCreatedConcurrently` was used to configure an index without parameters, the default was `false` - this has changed to `true`. Note that indexes are never configured for for concurrent creation unless `IsCreatedConcurrently` is specified.
