# 9.0 Release Notes

Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL version 9.0 is under development; previews are available on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL).

## UUIDv7 GUIDs are generated by default

When your entity types have a `Guid` key, EF Core by default generates key values for new entities client-side - in .NET - before inserting those entity types to the database; this can be better for performance in some situations. Before version 9.0, the provider generated random GUIDs (version 4) by calling the .NET [`Guid.NewGuid()`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.guid.newguid?view=net-8.0#system-guid-newguid) function. Unfortunately, random GUIDs aren't ideal for database indexing and can cause performance issues.

Version 9.0 of the provider now generates the recently standardized version 7 GUIDs, which is a sequential GUID type that's more appropriate for database indexes and improves their performance. This new behavior is by default and will take effect simply by upgrading the provider version.

See [this post](https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/unexpected-downsides-of-uuid-keys-in-postgresql) for more details and performance numbers on random vs. sequential GUIDs.
