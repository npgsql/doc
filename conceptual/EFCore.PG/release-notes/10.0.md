# 10.0 Release Notes

Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL version 10.0 is now in development, preview versions are available on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL).

## Support for PostgreSQL 8 virtual generated columns

Before PostgreSQL 18, generated (or "computed") columns could only be stored, meaning they were computed when a row is inserted or updated, and take up space on disk just like regular columns. PostgreSQL 18 introduced support for *virtual* generated columns, which are instead calculated when read, and take up no space on disk. Virtual columns can be defined with version 10 of the PostgreSQL provider as follows:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<Person>()
      .Property(p => p.DisplayName)
      .HasComputedColumnSql(@"""FirstName"" || ' ' || ""LastName""");
}
```

Note that previously, `stored: true` had to be specified in the above code sample; starting with version 10, omitting it causes a virtual generated column to be created (supported on PostgreSQL 18 only).

For more information, [see the documentation](../modeling/generated-properties.md#computed-generated-columns).

## Other new features

* When the target PostgreSQL is version is set to 18 (`.UseNpgsql("...", o => o.SetPostgresVersion(18, 0))`), translate [`Guid.CreateVersion7()`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.guid.createversion7) to the new [`uuidv7()`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/functions-uuid.html) function.
* NodaTime `LocalDate.At()` and `LocalDate.AtMidnight()` are now translated.

See the [10.0.0 milestone](https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/milestone/68?closed=1) for the full list of Npgsql EF provider issues.
