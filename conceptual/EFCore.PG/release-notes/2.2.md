# 2.2 Release Notes

Version 2.2.0 of the Npgsql Entity Framework Core provider has been released and is available on nuget. This version works with [version 2.2.0 of Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-2.2), and contains some new Npgsql features as well.

This release was result of hard work by [@roji](https://github.com/roji/), [@austindrenski](https://github.com/austindrenski), [@yohdeadfall](https://github.com/yohdeadfall) and [@khellang](https://github.com/khellang).

## New Features

Aside from general EF Core features new in 2.2.0, the Npgsql EF Core provider contains the following major new features:

### PostgreSQL 11 covering indexes

PostgreSQL 11 introduced [covering indexes feature](https://paquier.xyz/postgresql-2/postgres-11-covering-indexes), which allow you to include "non-key" columns in your indexes. This allows you to perform index-only scans and can provide a significant performance boost. Support has been added in ([#697](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/697)):

```csharp
protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder builder)
    => modelBuilder.Entity<Blog>()
                   .ForNpgsqlHasIndex(b => b.Id)
                   .ForNpgsqlInclude(b => b.Name);
```

This will create an index for searching on `Id`, but containing also the column `Name`, so that reading the latter will not involve accessing the table. [See the documentation for more details](../modeling/indexes.md).

Thanks to [@khellang](https://github.com/khellang) for contributing this!

### PostgreSQL user-defined ranges

The provider already supported [PostgreSQL range types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/rangetypes.html), but prior to 2.2 that support was limited to the built-in range types which come with PostgreSQL. [#329](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/329) extends that support to range types which you define:

```csharp
protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder builder)
    => builder.UseNpgsql("...", b => b.MapRange<float>("floatrange"));

protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder)
    => builder.ForNpgsqlHasRange("floatrange", "real");
```

This will make the provider create a PostgreSQL range called `floatrange`, over the PostgreSQL type `real`. Any property with type `NpgsqlRange<float>` will be seamlessly mapped to it.

[See the documentation for more details](../mapping/range.md).

### Seeding for Npgsql-specific types

When using some Npgsql-specific types, it wasn't possible to seed values for those types. With EF Core support for seeding any type, [#667](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/667) allows seeding values for network, bit and range types (more are coming).

### PostgreSQL index operator classes

PostgreSQL allows you to specify [operator classes on your indexes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-opclass.html), to allow tweaking how the index should work. [#481](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/481) adds support for managing these. [See the documentation for more details](../modeling/indexes.md).

Thanks to [@khellang](https://github.com/khellang) for contributing this!

### Other features

* Various issues with enum and range types were fixed, including upper/lower case, quoting and schema management.
* Many new SQL translations were added, so more of your LINQ expressions can run in the database. We'll be working on our documentation to make these more discoverable.
