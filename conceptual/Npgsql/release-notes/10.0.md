# Npgsql 10.0 Release Notes

Npgsql version 10.0 is now in development, preview versions are available on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Npgsql).

## Breaking changes

* The PostgreSQL network type `cidr` is now scaffolded to the new .NET [`IPNetwork`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.ipnetwork) type. The older Npgsql representation for `cidr` - the `NpgsqlCidr` type - has been obsoleted and will be removed in a future release.
