# Npgsql 7.0 Release Notes

Npgsql version 7.0 has been released and is available on nuget.

Npgsql 6.0 brings some major breaking changes and is not a simple in-place upgrade. Carefully read the breaking change notes below and upgrade with care.

## New features

The full list of issues for this release is [available here](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/milestone/71?closed=1).

### DbDataSource

### Improved logging with Microsoft.Extensions.Logging

Previous versions had a custom logging implementation which required special adapters and was hard to use. Npgsql 7.0 fully supports the standard .NET [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/logging) - just provide Npgsql with your `ILoggerFactory` and you're ready to go.

If you using ASP.NET, things are even easier with the new [Npgsql.DependencyInjection](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Npgsql.DependencyInjection), which takes care of seamlessly picking up the ASP.NET logging configuration from DI:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Logging.AddConsole();
builder.Services.AddNpgsqlDataSource("Host=localhost;Username=test;Password=test");
```

For more details, see the updated [logging documentation page](../diagnostics/logging.md).

## Breaking changes

### <a name="commandtype_storedprocedure" />CommandType.StoredProcedure now invokes procedures instead of functions

When [`NpgsqlCommand.CommandType`](https://www.npgsql.org/doc/api/Npgsql.NpgsqlCommand.html#Npgsql_NpgsqlCommand_CommandType) is set to [`CommandType.StoredProcedure`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.data.commandtype#system-data-commandtype-storedprocedure), Npgsql now generates SQL for invoking a PostgreSQL [stored procedure](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createprocedure.html), and not a [function](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createfunction.html), as before. To opt out of this breaking change and continue to invoke functions as before, enable the `Npgsql.EnableStoredProcedureCompatMode` [AppContext switch](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.appcontext) as follows:

```c#
AppContext.SetSwitch("Npgsql.EnableStoredProcedureCompatMode", true);
```

For context, PostgreSQL originally only supported functions, and did not support the standard SQL concept of stored procedures; because of this, [`CommandType.StoredProcedure`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.data.commandtype#system-data-commandtype-storedprocedure) was implemented to invoke functions. PostgreSQL 11 then introduced stored procedures, which have various advantages over functions in some scenarios (e.g. the ability to use transactions). The 7.0 release changes [`CommandType.StoredProcedure`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.data.commandtype#system-data-commandtype-storedprocedure) to invoke procedures as its naming suggests, and aligns Npgsql with other database providers for better compatibility.

Note that with Npgsql, there is no advantage in using [`CommandType.StoredProcedure`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.data.commandtype#system-data-commandtype-storedprocedure) over simply invoking your function or procedure via SQL. Doing so is in fact recommended:

```c#
// Invoke a procedure
using var command1 = new NpgsqlCommand("CALL some_procedure($1, $2)", connection)
{
    // Add parameters
};

// Invoke a function
using var command2 = new NpgsqlCommand("SELECT * FROM some_function($1, $2)", connection)
{
    // Add parameters
};
```
