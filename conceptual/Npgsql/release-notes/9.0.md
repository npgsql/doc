# Npgsql 9.0 Release Notes

Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL version 9.0 is out and available on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Npgsql).

> [!NOTE]
> We're considering to start dropping support for synchronous APIs (`NpgsqlConnection.Open`, `NpgsqlCommand.ExecuteNonQuery`, etc.) starting with Npgsql 10.0. The current plan is to deprecate the API by throwing a runtime exception by default (with a switch to re-enable synchronous I/O) for Npgsql 10.0, while possibly completely removing it for Npgsql 11.0. This is in line with ASP.NET Core and .NET runtime in general, which are moving in the direction of async I/O only (for example, `System.IO.Pipelines` doesn't have synchronous I/O). If you have any questions or want to share you experience/issues with async I/O, please feel free to post in the [issue](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/5865).

## Tracing improvements

Several quality-of-life improvements have been implemented for Npgsql's OpenTelemetry tracing support. You can now do the following via the new <xref:Npgsql.NpgsqlDataSourceBuilder.ConfigureTracingOptions*?displayProperty=nameWithType> API:

* Specify a filter which determines which commands get traced
* Set the the tracing span name (e.g. use the command's SQL as the span name)
* Add arbitrary tags to the tracing span, based on the command
* Disable the time-to-first-read event that's emitted in spans

See the [tracing documentation](/doc/diagnostics/tracing.html) for more information.

## Mapping improvements

### Add support for cidr <-> IPNetwork mapping

.NET 8 added a new type [IPNetwork](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.ipnetwork?view=net-8.0) which represents an IP network with an [IPAddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.ipaddress?view=net-8.0) containing the network prefix and an `int` defining the prefix length. This type seems to be a perfect fit for PostgreSQL's `cidr` type, which is why we added support to read and write it. The default when reading a `cidr` is still `NpgsqlCidr` in 9.0, though this will likely change in Npgsql 10.0. See [this issue](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/5821) for more info.

### Add support for interval's infinity values via NodaTime's Period.MinValue/Period.MaxValue

PostgreSQL 17 added support for infinity values with `interval` type. In turn, Npgsql 9.0 adds native support to read and write them via NodaTime's `Period.MinValue` and `Period.MaxValue`. Note that while using this feature with previous versions of PostgreSQL, instead of infinity values you'll get the minimum and maximum values for `interval` type due to the way infinity values are implemented by PostgreSQL. See [this issue](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/5696) for more info.

## Security-related improvements

* PostgreSQL 17 added support for **direct SSL**. Direct SSL allows clients to skip sending an SSL support request, which saves a roundtrip while opening a physical connection. This behavior is disabled by default (as it's not supported with previous versions of PostgreSQL), but you can enable it via the `SslNegotiation` property in connection string or environment variable `PGSSLNEGOTIATION`. See [this issue](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/5677) for more info.
* The new <xref:Npgsql.NpgsqlDataSourceBuilder.UseSslClientAuthenticationOptionsCallback*?displayProperty=nameWithType> callback is called while connecting to PostgreSQL via `SslStream`, and allows users to modify [SslClientAuthenticationOptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.security.sslclientauthenticationoptions?view=net-8.0), e.g. to change the supported TLS ciphers. See [this issue](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/5478) for more info.
* The new <xref:Npgsql.NpgsqlDataSourceBuilder.UseNegotiateOptionsCallback*?displayProperty=nameWithType> callback is called while performing GSSAPI authentication (such as Kerberos), and allows users to modify [NegotiateAuthenticationClientOptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.security.negotiateauthenticationclientoptions?view=net-8.0), e.g. to change the `Credential` property to implement password-based Kerberos authentication. See [this](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/5181) issue for more info.

## Replication improvements

* Parallel in-progress transactions with logical streaming replication protocol V4 allow clients to handle multiple in-progress transactions in parallel instead of sequentially. See [this issue](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/5760) for more info.
* <xref:Npgsql.Replication.PgOutput.ReplicationValue.GetFieldName?displayProperty=nameWithType> `ReplicationValue.GetFieldName` allows clients to receive the name of changed column while reading rows from replication stream. See [this issue](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/5718) for more info.

## Breaking changes

### .NET Standard 2.0 (and .NET Framework) is not supported

Npgsql 9.0 drops support for .NET Standard 2.0, and in turn .NET Framework. Npgsql is a constantly evolving driver, which makes it problematic to add new features which use APIs that do not exist on older versions of .NET. This doesn't mean you can't use Npgsql with .NET Standard 2.0: we're still committed to supporting Npgsql 8.0 (which does support .NET Standard 2.0). See [this issue](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/5296) for more info.

### Change some PgOutputReplicationOptions properties to support logical streaming replication protocol V4

The main changes are in the `PgOutputReplicationOptions` class, where `ProtocolVersion` and `StreamingMode` properties were changed to an enum. See [this issue](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/5760) for more info.

### Multiple ssl related callbacks on NpgsqlDataSourceBuilder are deprecated in favor of UseSslClientAuthenticationOptionsCallback

With the new `UseSslClientAuthenticationOptionsCallback` callback, users have much more control over the way Npgsql connects to PostgreSQL via `SslStream`. This makes other callbacks, like `UseUserCertificateValidationCallback` and `UseClientCertificate` less useful, which is why we're obsoleting them. See [this issue](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/5478) for more info.

### The default value of ConnectionLifetime property in connection string is set to 1 hour

Previously, the default value of this property was set to 0, which made connections last indefinitely. The old behavior was problematic because each physical connection on PostgreSQL's side holds on certain caches, which can only grow over time. See [this pull request](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/pull/5662) for more info.
