# Npgsql 8.0 Release Notes

**The below release notes and breaking changes list aren't yet complete. Check back soon for more notes.**

Npgsql version 8.0 is under development, and is available as release candidate versions.

## New features

### NativeAOT and trimming support

Npgsql 8.0 now has 1st-class support for NativeAOT and trimming; the entire library has been properly annotated and is safe for use in applications. The majority of features have been made compatible with NativeAOT/trimming and can be used without issues, and most applications using Npgsql can be used as-is with NativeAOT/trimming without any changes. A few features which are incompatible require an explicit code opt-in, which generates a warning if used with NativeAOT/trimming enabled ([see breaking change note](#dynamic-optin)).

Considerable effort has gone into reducing Npgsql's size footprint; a minimal Npgsql application using NativeAOT and trimming now takes only around 5MB of disk space. To allow users to achieve a minimal size footprint, <xref:Npgsql.NpgsqlSlimDataSourceBuilder> has been introduced; unlike the standard <xref:Npgsql.NpgsqlDataSourceBuilder>, this builder includes only the very minimum of functionality by default, and allows adding additional features via opt-ins. This allows a pay-per-play approach to application size, where developers can choose only the features they actually need for optimal size. For more information on <xref:Npgsql.NpgsqlDataSourceBuilder>

Making Npgsql NativeAOT/trimming-compatible was a far-reaching effort, affecting many parts of the driver and involving a rewrite of large parts of Npgsql's internals (leading to many other internal improvements). This huge task was done mainly by [Nino Floris](http://github.com/ninofloris), with considerable contributions by [Nikita Kazmin](https://github.com/vonzshik).

## Breaking changes

### <a name="dynamic-optin">JSON POCO and other dynamic features now require an explicit opt-in

Npgsql 8.0 is fully compatible with NativeAOT and trimming (see above). While most driver capabilities have been made to work in those profiles, certain features involve dynamic coding practices and are incompatible with NativeAOT and/or trimming - at least for now. As a result, these features now require explicit opt-ins (annotated to be incompatible with NativeAOT/trimming), which you must add either on your <xref:Npgsql.NpgsqlDataSourceBuilder> or on <xref:Npgsql.NpgsqlConnection.GlobalTypeMapper?displayProperty=nameWithType>:

PostgreSQL type                          | Default .NET type
---------------------------------------- | --------------------------
JSON POCO mapping, JsonNode and subtypes | <xref:Npgsql.INpgsqlTypeMapperExtensions.EnableDynamicJsonMappings>
Unmapped enums, ranges, multiranges      | <xref:Npgsql.INpgsqlTypeMapperExtensions.EnableUnmappedTypes>
Read PostgreSQL records as .NET tuples   | <xref:Npgsql.INpgsqlTypeMapperExtensions.EnableRecordsAsTuples>

Existing code using the above features will start throwing exceptions after upgrading to Npgsql 8.0; the exceptions provide explicit guidance on how to add the opt-ins.

### `SSL Mode=Require` no longer validates certificates

tl;dr use `SSL Mode=VerifyCA` or `VerifyFull` in order to validate certificates provided by PostgreSQL.

In versions of Npgsql older than 6.0, specifying `SSL Mode=Require` made Npgsql validate the SSL/TLS certificate provided by PostgreSQL. This did not align with the meaning of "require" in PostgreSQL and other clients, where it simply means that SSL/TLS is required, but without certificate validation. To align with the standard PostgreSQL meaning, starting with Npgsql 6.0 `VerifyCA` or `VerifyFull` must be specified to validate the certificate.

To prevent existing usage of `Require` to silently stop validating, Npgsql 6.0 and 7.0 forced `Trust Server Certificate=true` to be specified; this made users aware of the change, guiding them to either switch to `VerifyCA`/`VerifyFull` (if they want validation) or to add `Trust Server Certificate=true` (if they don't). After two major versions, we are now removing the requirement to specify `Trust Server Certificate=true` with `SSL Mode=Require`; the latter will behave in the standard PostgreSQL way and will not verify certificates.

For more context, see [#3988](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/3988#issuecomment-933011009).

### Plugin APIs have been changed for NativeAOT/trimming support

As part of the effort to make Npgsql compatible with NativeAOT and trimming, the plugin API was changed in fundamental, breaking ways. Although this API never had the stability guarantees of a true public API (it was and still is in an Internal namespace), external plugins which were developed with it will require adjustments.

> [!WARNING]
> If you're a plugin developer, be aware that some last API changes may still be done; it's advisable to wait until 8.0 is released before adapting your plugin. In any case, please reach out to us via Github issues if you encounter any issues or require guidance!
