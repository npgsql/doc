title: Npgsql 5.0 Release Notes (Preview)
---
Previews of version 5.0 of the Npgsql Entity Framework Core provider are available on nuget.org. If you'd like to try out a nightly build, you can use [the unstable feed](http://www.npgsql.org/doc/installation.html#unstable-packages).

The full list of issues for this release is [available here](https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/milestone/24?closed=1).

## Major new features

* *PostgreSQL logical and physical replication* ([#1520](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/1520)). This allows creating programs which receive a continuous, live stream of all updates happening in a PostgreSQL database or set of tables. It can be used for auditing purposes, replication certain (or all) changes to another database or format, or various other purposes. Full documentation will be available soon. This major feature was developed by [@Brar](https://github.com/Brar/), many thanks!
* Full and revamped support for *timeouts and cancellation* ([#3166](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/3166)). When the user requests cancellation (via a cancellation token or <xref:Npgsql.NpgsqlCommand.Cancel?displayProperty=nameWithType>), or when the [Command Timeout](http://www.npgsql.org/doc/connection-string-parameters.html#timeouts-and-keepalive) expires, Npgsql will now attempt to cancel the PostgreSQL command. If cancellation isn't successful within a short time window, Npgsql will close the physical connection and raise an exception, making sure the application isn't blocked. Previous support was inconsistent across cancellation and timeout, and async I/O was only partially supported.
* *Connection multiplexing* ([#1982](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/1982)). Multiplexing is an experimental new way for the driver to handle commands and connections, leading to a potentially significant reduction in PostgreSQL physical connection requirements. This feature is also providing a substantial performance boot on the [TechEmpower benchmark](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/) (next round to be published). Multiplexing is disabled by default, and must be opted into.; full documentation will be available soon.
* All Npgsql APIs are now fully annotated for *C# nullable references* ([#3120](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/3120)), in line with the new annotations in System.Data released in .NET 5.0.
* Reading PostgreSQL arrays as CLR *arrays of nullable value types* (e.g. `int?[]` is now supported ([#443](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/443)). Previously, only non-nullable value arrays were supported, and nulls were translated to the default value (e.g. 0).
* The connection pool can be configured to unconditionally *close connections which have reached a certain age* ([#1810](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/1810)). This can useful to rebalance connections in a distributed database scenario, or to mitigate certain resource leaks.

## Breaking changes

* Npgsql no longer targets .NET Framework 4.6.1. Since .NET Standard 2.0 is targeted, it is still possible to use Npgsql from .NET Framework applications; however, we no longer run regression tests on .NET Framework and will only fix bugs on a best-effort basis. In addition, the Visual Studio extension (VSIX) and the MSI GAC installer have been discontinued. [#3269](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/3269).
* Npgsql targets the `netcoreapp3.1` TFM instead of `netcoreapp3.0`, which is out of support ([#3160](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/3160)).
* When command timeout occurs, Npgsql now raises an <xref:Npgsql.NpgsqlException> wrapping a [TimeoutException](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.timeoutexception) ([#3132](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/3132)). Previously, an NpgsqlException wrapping an IOException was raised.
* Similarly, when cancellation occurs, Npgsql now raises an [OperationCanceledException](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.operationcanceledexception) when a command is cancelled (both via an async cancellation token, and via <xref:Npgsql.NpgsqlCommand.Cancel?displayProperty=nameWithType>). Previously, NpgsqlCommand.Cancel caused a <xref:Npgsql.PostgresException> to be raised instead.
* When reading PostgreSQL arrays, if a null value is being read into a CLR arrays of a non-nullable value type, an exception is now thrown ([#443](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/443)). Previously, the default value was populated instead. It is now possible to read arrays of nullable value types instead.
* Support for unmapped PostgreSQL composite types has been removed ([#2403](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/2403)).
* The ordering in which Npgsql checks alternative password sources has changed ([#2695](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/2695), [#2657](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/pull/2657)). This only affects applications which omit the password from the connection string.
* If the connection string specifies a PGPASS file, Npgsql now throws if that file doesn't exist ([#2694](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/2694)).
* The *TcpKeepAliveTime* and *TcpKeepAliveInterval* connection string parameters are now expressed in seconds instead of milliseconds ([#1936](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/1936)).
* The <xref:Npgsql.NpgsqlConnection.GetSchema?displayProperty=nameWithType> API now returns all indexes in the database ([2958](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/2958)). Previously, only indexes in the `search_path` were returned.
* <xref:Npgsql.NpgsqlOperationInProgressException> now inherits from <xref:Npgsql.NpgsqlException>.
* <xref:Npgsql.NpgsqlBinaryImporter.Complete?displayProperty=nameWithType> has been changed to return a `ulong` reporting the number of imported rows ([#2112](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/2112)).
* The [Npgsql.RawPostgis](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Npgsql.RawPostgis/) plugin has been discontinued ([#3201](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/3201)). Npgsql now allows any field to be read as raw binary data, so the plugin is no longer necessary.
* Support for non-standard-conforming strings has been dropped ([#2931](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/2931)).
