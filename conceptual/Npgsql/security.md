# Security and Encryption

## Logging in

The simplest way to log into PostgreSQL is by specifying a `Username` and a `Password` in your connection string. Depending on how your PostgreSQL is configured (in the `pg_hba.conf` file), Npgsql will send the password in MD5 or in cleartext (not recommended).

If a `Password` is not specified and your PostgreSQL is configured to request a password (plain or MD5), Npgsql will look for a [standard PostgreSQL password file](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-pgpass.html). If you specify the `Passfile` connection string parameter, the file it specifies will be used. If that parameter isn't defined, Npgsql will look under the path taken from `PGPASSFILE` environment variable. If the environment variable isn't defined, Npgsql will fall back to the system-dependent default directory which is `$HOME/.pgpass` for Unix and `%APPDATA%\postgresql\pgpass.conf` for Windows.

`NpgsqlConnection` can also be configured with a `ProvidePasswordCallback`. This will be executed when new database connections are opened to generate a password in code. This can be useful if you are using Amazon Web Services RDS for Postgres which can be configured to use short lived tokens generated based on access credentials. The `ProvidePasswordCallback` delegate is executed when both password and `Passfile` connection string parameters are not specified.

For documentation about all auth methods supported by PostgreSQL, [see this page](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/auth-methods.html). Note that Npgsql supports Unix-domain sockets (auth method `local`), simply set your `Host` parameter to the absolute path of your PostgreSQL socket directory, as configured in your `postgresql.conf`.

## Encryption (SSL/TLS)

By default PostgreSQL connections are unencrypted, but you can turn on SSL/TLS encryption if you wish. First, you have to set up your PostgreSQL to receive SSL/TLS connections [as described here](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ssl-tcp.html). Once that's done, specify `SSL Mode` in your connection string as detailed below.

### [Version 6.0+](#tab/tabid-1)

Starting with 6.0, the following `SSL Mode` values are supported (see the [PostgreSQL docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html#LIBPQ-SSL-SSLMODE-STATEMENTS) for more details):

SSL Mode            | Eavesdropping protection | Man-in-the-middle protection | Statement
------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------
Disable             | No                       | No                           | I don't care about security, and I don't want to pay the overhead of encryption.
Allow               | Maybe                    | No                           | I don't care about security, but I will pay the overhead of encryption if the server insists on it.
Prefer (default)    | Maybe                    | No                           | I don't care about encryption, but I wish to pay the overhead of encryption if the server supports it.
Require<sup>1</sup> | Yes                      | No                           | I want my data to be encrypted, and I accept the overhead. I trust that the network will make sure I always connect to the server I want.
VerifyCA            | Yes                      | Depends on CA policy         | I want my data encrypted, and I accept the overhead. I want to be sure that I connect to a server that I trust.
VerifyFull          | Yes                      | Yes                          | I want my data encrypted, and I accept the overhead. I want to be sure that I connect to a server I trust, and that it's the one I specify.

<sup>1</sup> `SSL Mode=Require` currently requires explicitly setting `Trust Server Certificate=true` as well (this requirement will be removed in a future version). This combination should be used with e.g. self-signed certificates, which don't need to be validated. As an alternative to `Trust Server Certificate=true`, provide your custom certificate validation via <xref:NpgsqlNpgsqlConnection.UserCertificateValidationCallback?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

The default mode in 6.0+ is `Prefer`, which allows SSL but does not require it, and does not validate certificates.

### [Older versions](#tab/tabid-2)

Versions prior to 6.0 supported the following `SSL Mode` values:

SSL Mode    | Eavesdropping protection | Man-in-the-middle protection | Statement
----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------
Disable     | No                       | No                           | I don't care about security, and I don't want to pay the overhead of encryption.
Prefer      | Maybe                    | Maybe                        | I don't care about encryption, but I wish to pay the overhead of encryption if the server supports it.
Require     | Yes                      | Yes                          | I want my data encrypted, and I accept the overhead. I want to be sure that I connect to a server I trust, and that it's the one I specify.

The default mode prior to 6.0 was `Disable`.

To disable certificate validation when using `Require`, set `Trust Server Certificate` to true; this allows connecting to servers with e.g. self-signed certificates, while still requiring encryption.

### Advanced server certificate validation

If the root CA of the server certificate isn't installed in your machine's CA store, validation will fail. Either install the certificate in your machine's CA store, or point to it via the `Root Certificate` connection string parameter or via the `PGSSLROOTCERT` environment variable.

Note that Npgsql does not perform certificate revocation validation by default, since this is an optional extension not implemented by all providers and CAs. To turn on certificate revocation validation, specify `Check Certificate Revocation=true` on the connection string.

Finally, if the above options aren't sufficient for your scenario, you can set <xref:NpgsqlNpgsqlConnection.UserCertificateValidationCallback?displayProperty=nameWithType> and define your custom server certificate validation logic (this gets set on the underlying .NET [`SslStream`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.security.sslstream.-ctor#System_Net_Security_SslStream__ctor_System_IO_Stream_System_Boolean_System_Net_Security_RemoteCertificateValidationCallback_System_Net_Security_LocalCertificateSelectionCallback_)).

### Client certificates

PostgreSQL may be configured to require valid certificates from connecting clients for authentication. Npgsql automatically sends client certificates specified in the following places:

* The `SSL Certificate` connection string parameter.
* The `PGSSLCERT` environment variable.
* The default locations of `~/.postgresql/postgresql.crt` (on Unix) or `%APPDATA%\postgresql\postgresql.crt` (on Windows)

To provide a password for a client certificate, set either the `SSL Password` (6.0 and higher) or `Client Certificate Key` (5.0 and lower) connection string parameter.

Finally, you can set `ProvideClientCertificatesCallback` on `NpgsqlConnection` to further customize how client certificates are provided (this works like on the underlying .NET [`SslStream`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.security.sslstream.-ctor#System_Net_Security_SslStream__ctor_System_IO_Stream_System_Boolean_System_Net_Security_RemoteCertificateValidationCallback_System_Net_Security_LocalCertificateSelectionCallback_)).

> [!NOTE]
> Npgsql supports .PFX and .PEM certificates starting with 6.0. Previously, only .PFX certificates were supported.

## Integrated Security (GSS/SSPI/Kerberos)

Logging in with a username and password may not be ideal, since your application must have access to your password, and raise questions around secret management. An alternate way of authenticating is "Integrated Security", which uses GSS or SSPI to negotiate Kerberos. The advantage of this method is that authentication is handed off to your operating system, using your already-open login session. Your application never needs to handle a password. You can use this method for a Kerberos login, Windows Active Directory or a local Windows session. Note that since 3.2, this method of authentication also works on non-Windows platforms.

Instructions on setting up Kerberos and SSPI are available in the [PostgreSQL auth methods docs](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/auth-methods.html). Some more instructions for SSPI are [available here](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Configuring_for_single_sign-on_using_SSPI_on_Windows).

Once your PostgreSQL is configured correctly, simply include `Integrated Security=true` in your connection string and drop the `Password` parameter. However, Npgsql must still send a username to PostgreSQL. If you specify a `Username` connection string parameter, Npgsql will send that as usual. If you omit it, Npgsql will attempt to detect your system username, including the Kerberos realm. Note that by default, PostgreSQL expects your Kerberos realm to be sent in your username (e.g. `username@REALM`); you can have Npgsql detect the realm by setting `Include Realm` to true in your connection string. Alternatively, you can disable add `include_realm=0` in your PostgreSQL's pg_hba.conf entry, which will make it strip the realm. You always have the possibility of explicitly specifying the username sent to PostgreSQL yourself.
