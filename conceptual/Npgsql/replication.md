# Logical and Physical Replication

> [!NOTE]
> This feature was introduced in Npgsql 5.0.

Replication allows a client to receive a continuous stream of updates from a PostgreSQL database, providing a near-realtime view of all changes as they occur. While this feature was originally developed to keep PostgreSQL standby replicas in sync with a primary, it can be used by arbitrary applications to get an update feed from a PostgreSQL server.

Npgsql provides a 1st-class API for writing .NET replication clients, detailed below. While PostgreSQL supports both logical and physical replication, in the majority of cases .NET applications will want to use logical replication.

> [!WARNING]
> Replication support is new in Npgsql and should be considered a bit experimental. Some APIs may change based on user feedback.

## Logical replication

Logical replication is a means to stream messages generated by PostgreSQL [logical decoding](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logicaldecoding.html) plugins to a client.
The default implementation that is used by PostgreSQL itself to perform logical server to server replication is the Logical Streaming Replication Protocol which uses the `pgoutput` plugin, but PostgreSQL supports streaming messages generated by other plugins too and Npgsql supports receiving those.

### General setup

To set up logical replication, follow the [quick setup instructions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-quick-setup.html) in the PostgreSQL docs (note that a SUBSCRIPTION isn't required since the client isn't PostgreSQL):

* Enable logical replication in your `postgresql.conf` file:

```ini
wal_level = logical
```

* Set up a replication user in your [`pg_hba.conf`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html) file:

```text
host     replication     repuser     0.0.0.0/0     md5
```

The user `repuser` must exist in your cluster and either be a superuser or have the replication attribute set. See [CREATE ROLE docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createrole.html).

### Logical Streaming Replication Protocol (pgoutput plugin)

The modern, recommended way to perform logical replication was introduced in PostgreSQL 10 - [see the PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html). This method, using the built-in pgoutput replication plugin, streams efficient, binary messages to represent database updates such as INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE ([see the full list](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-logicalrep-message-formats.html)); Npgsql exposes these messages as an `IAsyncEnumerable` which can easily be enumerated and consumed.

* [Create a publication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpublication.html), which defines the group of tables in the database you wish to replicate:

```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION blog_pub FOR TABLE blogs;
```

* Create a replication slot, which will hold the state of the replication stream:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_create_logical_replication_slot('blog_slot', 'pgoutput');
```

If your application goes down, the slot persistently records the last data streamed to it, and allows resuming the application at the point where it left off.

At this point, everything is ready to start replicating! Create this simple .NET program with Npgsql:

```csharp
await using var conn = new LogicalReplicationConnection("<connection_string>");
await conn.Open();

var slot = new PgOutputReplicationSlot("blog_slot");

// The following will loop until the cancellation token is triggered, and will print message types coming from PostgreSQL:
var cancellationTokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();
await foreach (var message in conn.StartReplication(
    slot, new PgOutputReplicationOptions("blog_pub"), cancellationTokenSource.Token))
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Received message type: {message.GetType().Name}");
}
```

For example, if you insert a new row into your `blogs` table, you should see the following output:

```output
Received message type: BeginMessage
Received message type: RelationMessage
Received message type: InsertMessage
Received message type: CommitMessage
```

> [!WARNING]
> Npgsql internally recycles the message instances it hands out. It is an error to use a message received from `StartReplication` once the next message has been read.

The above was just a minimal "getting started" guide for logical replication - many additional configuration options and modes exist as well. Consult the PostgreSQL documentation for more details.

### Test decoding (test_decoding plugin)

An additional logical replication plugin which Npgsql supports is `test_decoding`. This plugin outputs textual representations of events, which are less efficient and need to be parsed; it is meant for testing that replication works rather than for building robust production apps. However, it can still be useful in some scenarios, especially in older PostgreSQL versions where `pgoutput` wasn't yet introduced.

To use `test_decoding`, first create a logical replication slot with `test_decoding` as the plugin type.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_create_logical_replication_slot('blog_slot', '`test_decoding`');
```

After that use the following:

```csharp
await using var conn = new LogicalReplicationConnection("Host=localhost;Username=test;Password=test");
await conn.Open();

var slot = new TestDecodingReplicationSlot("blog_slot");

// The following will loop until the cancellation token is triggered, and will print message types coming from PostgreSQL:
var cancellationTokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();
await foreach (var message in conn.StartReplication(slot, cancellationTokenSource.Token))
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Message: {message.Data}");
}
```

Inserting a row will produce the following string messages:

```output
Message: BEGIN 230413
Message: table public.blogs: INSERT: id[integer]:2 name[text]:'blog1'
Message: COMMIT 230413
```

> [!WARNING]
> Npgsql internally recycles the message instances it hands out. It is an error to use a message received from `StartReplication` once the next message has been read.

## Physical replication

Finally, PostgreSQL also supports physical replication, which streams raw block data rather than logical events on changes. While useful for synchronizing PostgreSQL replicas and supported by Npgsql, this mode is unlikely to be useful for a typical .NET program client.
