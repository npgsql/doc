# Connection String Parameters

To connect to a database, the application provides a connection string which specifies parameters such as the host, the username, the password, etc. Connection strings have the form `keyword1=value; keyword2=value;` and are case-insensitive. Values containing special characters (e.g. semicolons) can be double-quoted. For more information, [see the official doc page on connection strings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/connection-strings).

Below are the connection string parameters which Npgsql understands, as well as some standard PostgreSQL environment variables.

## Basic connection

Username     | The username to connect with. Not required if using IntegratedSecurity.            | PGUSER

## Timeouts and keepalive

Parameter                | Description                                                  | Default

Socket Send Buffer Size    | Determines the size of socket send buffer. | System-dependent
No Reset On Close          | Improves performance in some cases by not resetting the connection state when it is returned to the pool, at the cost of leaking state. Use only if benchmarking shows a performance improvement | false

## Environment variables

In addition to the connection string parameters above, Npgsql also recognizes the standard PostgreSQL environment variables below. This helps Npgsql-based applications behave similar to other, non-.NET PostgreSQL client applications. The PostgreSQL doc page on environment variables recognized by libpq can be found [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-envars.html).

Environment variable | Description
-------------------- | -----------
PGUSER               | Behaves the same as the [user](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNECT-USER) connection parameter.
PGPASSWORD           | Behaves the same as the [password](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNECT-PASSWORD) connection parameter. Use of this environment variable is not recommended for security reasons, as some operating systems allow non-root users to see process environment variables via ps; instead consider using a password file (see [Section 33.15](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgpass.html)).
PGPASSFILE           | Behaves the same as the [passfile](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNECT-PASSFILE) connection parameter.
PGSSLCERT            | Behaves the same as the [sslcert](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNECT-SSLCERT) connection parameter.
PGSSLKEY             | Behaves the same as the [sslkey](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNECT-SSLKEY) connection parameter.
PGSSLROOTCERT        | Behaves the same as the [sslrootcert](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNECT-SSLROOTCERT) connection parameter.
PGCLIENTENCODING     | Behaves the same as the [client_encoding](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNECT-CLIENT-ENCODING) connection parameter.
PGTZ                 | Sets the default time zone. (Equivalent to SET timezone TO ....)
PGOPTIONS            | Behaves the same as the [options](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNECT-OPTIONS) connection parameter.
